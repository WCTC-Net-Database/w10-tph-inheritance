/// TABLE-PER-HIERARCHY (TPH) EXPLAINED:
/// ==================================
/// In TPH, all types in the hierarchy are stored in ONE table.
/// EF Core uses a "discriminator" column to know which type each row is.
///
/// Example of what the Abilities table looks like:
/// | Id | Name      | Description              | AbilityType    | Shove | Taunt |
/// |----|-----------|--------------------------|----------------|-------|-------|
/// | 1  | Push      | Push enemy back          | PlayerAbility  | 10    | NULL  |
/// | 2  | Mock      | Taunt the enemy          | GoblinAbility  | NULL  | 5     |
///
/// Notice:
/// - AbilityType is the DISCRIMINATOR - it tells EF Core which class to create
/// - Shove is only used by PlayerAbility (NULL for others)
/// - Taunt is only used by GoblinAbility (NULL for others)
///
/// This is the same pattern used for Character (Player vs Goblin)!
/// </summary>
